# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
##### is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. RFCs 2131 and 2132 define DHCP as an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
# Why use DHCP?

###### Every device on a TCP/IP-based network must have a unique unicast IP address to access the network and its resources.
